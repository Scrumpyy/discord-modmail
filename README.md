# discord-modmail
A simple Python Discord ModMail bot built using nextcord.

### Currently in development, not in a functional state & should not be used.
## Roadmap

- Add the ability to open new modmail threads.
- Add the ability to toggle between anonymised and non-anonymised modmail thread options (to prevent users with client mods from harrassing users who open threads).
- Add the ability for staff to respond to modmail threads anonymously.
- Add some form of public API to allow for the uploading of modmail logs.


## Deployment

To get started with your own version of this bot, please run the following;

```py
python setup.py
```
